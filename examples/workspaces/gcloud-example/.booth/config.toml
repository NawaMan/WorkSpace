# Mount gcloud credentials from host
# TODO: Find a way to seed instead of bind mount, so container changes
#       don't affect host credentials. The cb-home-seed pattern doesn't
#       work here because gcloud uses SQLite databases that require
#       write access even for reading (WAL mode, locks, etc.).
